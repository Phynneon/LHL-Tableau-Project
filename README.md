# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The goal of the Data Analysis project is to study different dataset with Tableau.
 The main objectives are:
- Build different visualizations to better understand the data
- Analysis of different relationship within the dataset
- Set up a dashboard that can be used to answer questions we have about the dataset


## Process
### Step 1: 
Going through the dataset and set up different visualizations to better understand the data, the trend and the relationships.
### Step 2:
Using the visualization tables to analyze the data and set up a dashboard to answer potential questions about the dataset. 


## Results
Option 2 was chosen for this project. The main dataset used was the FAA wildlife strikes dataset. The main queries for the dataset are:
- Which region tend to have the most incidents?
- What kind of wildlife tend to be involved with the collisions?
- Is there a time where the collisions are the most frequent?
- What kind of damage does the collision by wildlife tend to cause?

The analysis was mostly performed using bar charts with a bit of map and a bit of line plot. The analysis showed that:
- The states of California, Texas, Florida and New York have the highest count of collision between aircrafts and wildlife. 
- birds count for the vast majority of recorded collisions, with some bats and terrestial animals here and there. 
- Collisions mostly happen during daytime, a bit during night time and are much less likely to happen during dawn and dusk. 
- Warmer season have a lot higher number of collisions happening compared to colder seasons. The collision count increase from the start of the year to a highest point in August before gradually declining as the seasons get colder. 
- Most of the collisions do not cause any damage to the aircraft, but there are cases of sustantial damage or even destroyed aircraft in very rare occasions. The percentage of destroyed aircraft onyl consists of 0.12% if the totoal recorded collisions. 

The Airbnb dataset was also analyzed for this project. The main query was about the average cost of rental across different neighborhood in New York as well as the average cost of different type of rentals. 

The analysis show that Manhattan is the region with the highest average cost of rental while Bronx is the region with the cheapest rentals. Villa seems to be the most costly type of rental and the most expensive type of rental room is the entire home/appartment. 


## Challenges 
The project was mostly straightforward. The biggest challenge was dealing with data quality and outliers as well as null values. 

## Future Goals
If there was more time to work on the project, I would spend longer veryfing the integrity of the data and investigate the outliers. In the Airbnb case, some outliers severely increased the average price of rental for certain categories.
